# Assignment-5
Module 6: Data Structures and Strings in Python

Overview
This assignment focuses on using Python data structures such as dictionaries and lists, along with string handling and slicing techniques. It contains two tasks:

Task 1 works with dictionaries to store and retrieve student marks.

Task 2 demonstrates list slicing and reversing operations.

Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks
Problem Statement
Write a Python program that:

Creates a dictionary where student names are keys and their marks are values.

Asks the user to input a student's name.

Retrieves and displays the corresponding marks.

If the studentâ€™s name is not found, display an appropriate message.

Example Output
Case 1: Student exists in dictionary
Enter the student's name: Alice
Alice's marks: 85
Case 2: Student does not exist
Enter the student's name: John
Student 'John' not found in the records.

Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing
Problem Statement
Write a Python program that:

Creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10.

Extracts the first five elements from the list.

Reverses these extracted elements.

Prints both the extracted list and the reversed list.

Example Output
Extracted list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Reversed list: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

Concepts Used
Dictionaries: Key-value storage for quick lookups.

List Slicing: Extracting specific portions of a list using indexing.

List Reversal: Using list(reverse) to reverse order.

Conditional Checks: Using if-else statements for logic handling.

User Input Handling: Using input() to interact with the user.

How to Run the Programs
Save each task in a separate .py file (e.g., task1.py and task2.py).

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the folder containing the files.

Run the programs using:
python task1.py
python task2.py
